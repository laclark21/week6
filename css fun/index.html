<div> Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
  How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high,
  Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
  How I wonder what you are! When the blazing sun is gone,
  When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light,
   Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.</div>
